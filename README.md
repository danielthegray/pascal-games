# Old board games in Pascal

As a teenager discovering programming, I implemented a few board games in
Pascal. These were compiled using Turbo Pascal 7.0 and run on DOS.

I have included the EXE files in case you don't have Turbo Pascal available.
You can execute them in [DOSBox](https://www.dosbox.com). To do that, mount
the folder you put them in:

`Z:\>mount c /path/to/repo_folder`

and type in the EXE filename. It should run in graphics mode.

It will use the mouse (and DOSBox traps the mouse, like some virtual
machines do). To un-trap the mouse, press Control-F10. Other special
keys in DOSBox can be found
[at this link](https://www.dosbox.com/wiki/Special_Keys).

I might play with them and add some things in the future, but for now I'm
uploading them for archiving purposes.
